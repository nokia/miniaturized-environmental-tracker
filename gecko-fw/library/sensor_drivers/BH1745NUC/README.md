The original source code is intended for Arduino and thus expects Arduino.h and Wire.h include files to be available. Since these are not suitable for the EMCD DataLogger/Gatekeeper/Patchkeeper environments the code has to be slightly modified. To aid with this the code has been forked into Philip Derrick's personal github account to allow for modifications in a submodule context.
